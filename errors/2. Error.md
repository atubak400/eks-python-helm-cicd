Most of the errors you faced (kubectl config errors, authentication plugin errors) were not because of Terraform itself — they were caused by how GitHub Actions connects to EKS using IAM authentication after the cluster was created. Terraform apply successfully created the EKS cluster and IAM roles, but it didn’t automatically configure a GitHub Actions user or the kubeconfig properly for GitHub to authenticate in a CI/CD environment. If you wanted to avoid these issues earlier, you could have (1) pre-created a special IAM Role specifically for GitHub Actions with proper EKS permissions, (2) used the correct Kubernetes authentication (aws eks get-token) setup immediately after Terraform, and (3) tested kubectl get nodes as the GitHub Actions user locally to make sure tokens and kubeconfigs would work. Terraform does not automatically fix kubeconfig user contexts — you always need to think about it separately for GitHub CI/CD automation.
