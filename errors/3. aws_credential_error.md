# Fixing Terraform Destroy Error: Expired or Invalid AWS Credentials

## Introduction

In this guide, we describe how we resolved a Terraform error that occurred when trying to run `terraform destroy`. The error was related to AWS credential issues, specifically an expired or invalid token. The troubleshooting process involved checking the environment variables, resetting AWS credentials, and confirming that Terraform could properly authenticate to AWS.

## Initial Problem

When running `terraform destroy`, the following error appeared:

```
Error: Retrieving AWS account details: validating provider credentials: retrieving caller identity from STS: operation error STS: GetCallerIdentity, https response error StatusCode: 403, RequestID: ..., api error ExpiredToken: The security token included in the request is expired
```

Later, after updating the access keys, another error occurred:

```
Error: Retrieving AWS account details: validating provider credentials: retrieving caller identity from STS: operation error STS: GetCallerIdentity, https response error StatusCode: 403, RequestID: ..., api error InvalidClientTokenId: The security token included in the request is invalid
```

## Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Identified Credential Source:**
   We confirmed that the AWS credentials were being loaded from environment variables using `aws configure list`.

2. **Checked Exported Environment Variables:**
   We used `echo $AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `echo $AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` to verify the currently exported keys.

3. **Unset Old Session Token:**
   Since the user was not using temporary credentials, we ran `unset AWS_SESSION_TOKEN` to avoid conflicts.

4. **Created New AWS Access Keys:**
   The user generated new AWS access and secret keys from the AWS Console (IAM section).

5. **Exported New Credentials:**
   The new keys were exported into the environment using:

   ```bash
   export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=new_access_key
   export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=new_secret_key
   ```

6. **Confirmed Valid Credentials:**
   We verified by running `aws sts get-caller-identity`, which successfully returned the user's AWS account and identity details.

7. **Ran Terraform Destroy:**
   After all the above steps, the user was able to proceed with `terraform destroy` without any errors.

## Explanation of the Error

The error happened because the AWS credentials that Terraform was trying to use had expired or were invalid. Terraform needs valid AWS access to retrieve resources and apply/destroy changes. If environment variables hold expired or wrong keys, AWS will reject any requests with an "ExpiredToken" or "InvalidClientTokenId" error. Fixing it required resetting the environment with new access keys, ensuring no old session tokens remained, and verifying credentials with AWS CLI before retrying Terraform commands.

## Conclusion

Whenever you see "ExpiredToken" or "InvalidClientTokenId" in Terraform, it is almost always a credentials issue. Always check your environment variables, unset any unnecessary tokens, export fresh credentials, and validate with `aws sts get-caller-identity` before running Terraform commands again. This process ensures a smooth and error-free experience with Terraform and AWS.
